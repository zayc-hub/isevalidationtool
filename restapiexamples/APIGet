# This will make a HTTP GET request to `http://localhost:8080/v1/books` and
# store the HTTP response in a variable called `books`.

# If everything went well, we can now print out the contents of the HTTP response to the screen.
# Since the virtual library API is producing Content-Type "application/json"
# We can leverage the .json() function that will transform the HTTP Response body to a Python dictionary.
